# Blade
A mobile client (Android) for the Blade web application

# Setup
The web client was ported to Android using Cordova, so Cordova is needed to build the application. You can install Cordova using npm with the following line: 
npm install -g cordova

Once you have Cordova installed, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: 
cordova platform add android

Finally, run "cordova build android" which builds a debug version of the apk.

# How do I play?
The mobile client has no tutorial. However, there is a tutorial page included in the web application shown in the demo above.

# Drawbacks
Unlike the web client, be aware that the mobile client does not allow you to change your username or use any chat features.
